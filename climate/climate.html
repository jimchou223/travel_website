                    <h2>Overview</h2>

                    <p>Locating at the border of tropical and sub tropical zone, makes Taiwan a typical the humid
                        subtropical climate. The humidity will strengthen the temperature,
                        sometimes you will feel hotter or colder than the real temperature. The typical typhoon season
                        is June to September, if you are
                        planning to visit Taiwan during that season, you'd better keep your eyes on the weather
                        forecast. Sometimes typhoon causes damage to a certain degree and the transportation will be a
                        mess. But without that, Taiwan is absolutely a great place to visit.
