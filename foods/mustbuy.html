                    <h2>Taiwan Souvenir</h2>
                    <p>For those who enjoys shopping during the trip or you are that kind fo person who loves to buy
                        souvenir for family and friends, here is a good news. Taiwan is also famous for some special
                        stuffs thatare suitable for everyone. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="main-intro-part-two">
                    <h2>Pineapple cakes</h2>

                    <p>It's a traditional Taiwanese cake. Unlike the western cake, the size of it is tiny which is
                        suitable for everyone. You can enjoy it alone or with family and friends. It is also popular for
                        local Taiwanese during the some chinese festivals. People will send each other pineapple cake as
                        gifts. In some famous pineapple bakery, you might find the people lining around you are actually
                        Taiwanese. There are even some poeple dislike fruits but love pineapple a lot.</p>

                <div class="main-intro-part-one">
                    <h2>Oolong tea</h2>
                    <p>Taiwan has a distinct tea culture; if you are tea lovers you will love Taipei undoubtedly. 
                        Even if you can see starbucks here and there, Taiwan is more of a tea-drinking country after all. In New Taipei City, you’ll find the rural district of Pinglin — known for tea plantations, tea shops, and the Pinglin Tea Museum. If you buy the pinapple cake, it is also recommanded to buy some oolong tea. You can brew a cup of oolong tea, and enjoy it with the pineapple cake. The tea will balance and even more make the flavor stand out in your mouth.
                        But if you don’t have time to go on a Pinglin tour, you’ll also find loose-leaf oolong tea all
                        over Taipei. They sell it per pack or per canister.</p>

                    <h2>Nougat bars</h2>
                    <p>If you really don't like fruity desserts, then perhaps the soft and sticky goodness of Taiwan’s peanut nougat bars will be your choice. This is also my personal favourite. It originally came from France but Taiwanese people mixed it with our preference and created a unique, tasty version. It's not too sweet, suitable for everyone.</p>
