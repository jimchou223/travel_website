                    <p>Taiwan is an island of unexpected beauty. It also has a mysterious name called "Formosa". In
                        order to realize the meaning behind this mysterious name, we need to go back to 16th century,
                        the Age of Discovery. At that time a Portuguese ship accidentally sailed through the Taiwan
                        Strait. The sailors were astonished by the beautiful scenery they saw, one of them couldn't help
                        but shouted "Ilha Formosa", means a beautiful island in English. That is the history behind the
                        name. Just like the meaning of that name, Taiwan is an island of beauty. In the country side,
                        you can find small villages surrounded by hills and forests to roam in, it's an ideal
                        destination for those who love to spend their vacation exploring the outdoors. Not only the
                        natural scenery, Taiwan is also famous for the diversity, especially when it comes to food,
                        religion, architecture, language, living habits. Taiwan was ruled by different countries like
                        Netherlands, Spain, Japanese. Due to the complex historical events and background, it's a place
                        filled with cultures. Taiwanese people mixed those different culture and shape them into the way
                        it look and feel like in Taiwan now.

                    <h2>Location</h2>
                    <p>Taiwan is located in between the southeastern coast of the Asian continent and the East Asian
                        islands. Japan and the Ryukyu Islands is at the North east side; to the south are the Philippine
                        Islands; to the west is Mainland China. Taiwan is a long and narrow island stretching from north
                        to south. The island is about 395 km long vertically and about 144 km in width with a total land
                        area of around 36,000 square kilometers (about 14,400 square miles). Center Taiwan is occupied
                        with steep mountains; therefore, great altitude differences occur throughout the island. The
                        mountains mostly run from north to south. The highest point is Yushan Peak of the Yushan
                        Mountain Range, which reaches an elevation of 3,952 meters above sea level making it the highest
                        peak in Northeast Asia. Since mountain areas cover the majority of the island, Taiwanâ€™s
                        ecological resources are abundant. There are various of species can only be found in Taiwan.</p>
