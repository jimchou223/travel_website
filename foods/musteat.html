                    <h2>Food in Taiwan</h2>
                    <p>Taiwan is really a kingdom of delicius food. The diversity of culture mixes and breeds the Taiwanese food. There are many different kinds of foods waiting for you to experience. And here lists some of them that you don't want to miss. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="main-intro-part-one">
                    <h2>Beef noodles</h2>

                    <p>The first typical food for Taiwan. If you ask people on the street what is the cuisine that Taiwan is famous for and which can represent Taiwan most? The common answer might be the beef noodles. There are two kinds of beef noodles, braised and clear stewed that come with stewed sirloin and cow tendon. Street vendors and old shops alike endeavor to cook the best beef noodles of the finest taste, and beef noodles have become the pride of Taiwan.</p>

                <div class="main-intro-part-one">
                    <h2>Stinky tofu</h2>
                    <p>Stinky tofu is one of the must try food in Taiwan, but unlike the others not everyone likes it. It is named after the special flavor of fermented tofu. Whether it is deep fried or steamed and stewed, that unique flavor is what makes it an iconic local snack. Most stinky tofu vendors in Taiwan offer deep fried ones with non-spicy Taiwanese kimchi or sichuan kimchi as a side dish to cover off the smell of the tofu. Some are big fan of it while some one only can bare with one piece. But anyway it is try worthy. You can not say that you've beeb to Taiwan without trying the stinky Tofu.</p>

                <div class="main-intro-part-one">
                    <h2>Soup Dumplings</h2>
                    <p>Another Taiwan's pride may be the soup dumpling, which is called "Shao Lung Bao" in Mandarin. One of the most famous restaurant is Din Tai Fung which owns a lot of branches all over the world. But if you plan to visit Taiwan, it is recommanded to visit the original store in Taipei Yong Kang street. You wil find the original taste of it. Traditional soup dumplings have at least 14 folds each, but in some stores that are particularly dainty about soup dumplings like Din Tai Fung, a soup dumpling might have over 18 folds. </p>
