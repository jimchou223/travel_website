                    <h2>Taroko Gorge -- A smaller Grand Canyon of Taiwan</h2>
                    <p>Taroko Gorge is one of Taiwan’s most popular tourist attractions, and it’s easy to realize the
                        reason. This incredible stretch of natural beauty with its waterfalls and ravines is in itself
                        quite spectacular, and when you add to that the sometimes precariously positioned temples, it’s
                        a must-see for every visitor. But instead of following the same old route that the tour bus
                        masses take each and every day, why not take a closer look at Taiwan’s most beautiful national
                        park by exploring it by yourself on foot.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="main-intro-part-two">
                    <h2>Landscape</h2>
                    <p>The most phenomenal aspect of the park is the amazing relief. In a single afternoon you can
                        travel from coastal cliffs through a maze of subtropical forested canyons to high
                        elevation subalpine coniferous forests. In about 60 kilometers the landscape rises from sea
                        level to some of the tallest peaks in Taiwan at over 3400 meters. That's steep!The force behind
                        the steep valleys and narrow canyons is a (geologically speaking) relatively fast rate of ample water. Over the last 70 million years, these two forces collaborated to form
                        the world's deepest marble canyon. The slot canyons here are remarkable with narrows sections a
                        thousand feet high and only a dozen yards apart, reminiscent of the Virgin River in Zion
                        National Park in Utah, USA. Ignore the fact that Zion is in the desert, and made of sandstone
                        and Taroko is subtropical and comprised of marble, and these two gorges have a lot in common.

                    <h2>Zhuilu Old Trail</h2>
                    <p>If you want to explore spots that are rarely known by most of the people or enjoying the
                        adventure in the wild? The Zhuilu Old Trail will be the best choice for you to go. The infamous
                        Zhuilu Old Trail, historically called the “Zhuilu Old Road”, was originally built as a hunting
                        path by the indigenous Truku tribes people in the early 1800’s. Used to access remote swaths of
                        mountainous jungle, rife with wild boar, the Truku tribespeople made the perilous journey
                        bearing machete’s, facial tattoos, and of course, courage beyond reason. Why did they need so
                        much courage you may ask? Because the narrow path, 750 meters above the canyon floor, was a mere
                        30cm (11 inches!) wide at the time! <a
